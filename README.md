# Introduction
This library is written for interfacing with the Hall Effect Sensor Si7210 (part B-04).
It was made to simply get measurements from the hall effect sensor using the
easiest approach. Yes I know it's actually "Si" not "SI" but unfortunately you can't
change the name of a published library!
